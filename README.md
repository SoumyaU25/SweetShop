My AI Usage:

I used ChatGPT (GPT-5) as a coding partner during different stages of building SweetShop.

Here‚Äôs how it actually helped:

Initial Setup:

I asked for guidance on structuring the project‚Äîsetting up the Express backend with MongoDB, configuring React with Vite, and organizing the folder layout.
This saved time in the early scaffolding phase but I wrote all the files myself.

Feature Development & Debugging

1. Search Functionality: I discussed how to design a flexible API that could filter sweets by name, category, and price range, then adapted the code to my needs.

2. Update/Delete Flows: When the update route was throwing errors, I shared the controller code and used ChatGPT‚Äôs feedback to fix the route parameters and error handling.

3. Admin Dashboard: I leaned on ChatGPT for advice on form handling and connecting the Cloudinary upload flow to the backend, while customizing the final logic and UI.

Testing

For backend Jest tests (authentication and sweet routes), I asked ChatGPT for example test structures and assertions.
I then modified the suggested tests to fit my exact schema and middleware.

Reflection

ChatGPT acted more like a senior developer I could bounce ideas off of than a code generator.
It sped up problem-solving and gave me confidence when writing tests, but every implementation detail and final decision remained in my hands.

Thankyou, have a good day :)
